When working with React files:

General Principles
- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure components logically: exports, subcomponents, helpers, types
- use Camel Case for file names and functions

Make code changes without asking
